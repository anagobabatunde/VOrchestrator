# VOrchestrator Future Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development roadmap for VOrchestrator, our lightweight container orchestration tool. This roadmap is subject to change based on user feedback and community needs.

## Near-term Improvements (v0.2.0)

### 1. Enhanced Health Monitoring
- Custom health check commands for specific container types
- Configurable health check intervals and timeouts
- Notification options for unhealthy containers (e.g., webhook, email)
- Automatic recovery actions for failed containers

### 2. Configuration Enhancements
- Support for YAML configuration as an alternative to JSON
- Environment variable substitution in configuration files
- Include/import capability to split large configurations
- Default configurations for common application stacks

### 3. Resource Constraints
- Add support for CPU and memory limits
- Simple resource allocation controls
- Basic autoscaling based on CPU/memory thresholds
- Resource usage reporting

## Mid-term Goals (v0.3.0 - v0.4.0)

### 4. Persistent Volumes
- Support for named volumes
- Volume backup and restore commands
- Configuration options for bind mounts and volumes
- Data persistence across container restarts

### 5. Networking Improvements
- Custom network creation and management
- Simple service discovery between containers
- Basic DNS resolution between services
- Network isolation options

### 6. Deployment Patterns
- Rolling updates with configurable strategies
- Blue/green deployment support
- Simple canary deployments
- Deployment history and rollback functionality

## Long-term Vision (v0.5.0+)

### 7. Multi-host Support
- Basic cluster management for multiple hosts
- Container distribution across nodes
- Simple leader election for high availability
- Cross-host networking

### 8. Extended Runtime Support
- Support for Podman as an alternative container runtime
- Basic compatibility with containerd
- Abstract container runtime interface
- OCI standard compliance

### 9. Developer Experience
- Docker Compose compatibility layer
- Integration with common CI/CD tools
- Plugin system for extensibility
- Interactive web UI for management (optional)

### 10. Observability
- Built-in metrics collection
- Prometheus endpoint for monitoring
- Basic dashboard for visualizing container performance
- Log aggregation and search

### 11. Security Enhancements
- Container vulnerability scanning
- Secret management integration
- Network policy enforcement
- Role-based access control

## Maintenance & Quality

- Regular performance benchmarking and optimization
- Comprehensive testing for all platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)
